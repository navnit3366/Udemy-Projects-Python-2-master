# üíª About 
**This is the part 2 of [Python Projects first part](https://github.com/Damsith-LK/Udemy-Projects)**


## üöÄ Projects I have completed and days I have finished:


- ### Renting Research üè† (Day 53)
> 1. First of all, program send a request to the relevant webpage and retrieves the content
> 2. Then it sort out the information of houses to separate lists (prices, links and addresses)
> 3. After that, using Selenium, the program fills the google form
> 4. Note that, one house is one google form submit so the program fills forms until no more houses
> 5. The information filled in the forms can be seen in a google sheet associated with it (This not a part of the code)


- ### Twitter Follower Bot ü§ñ (Day 52)
> 1. First of all, the program logs into the twitter
> 2. Then, it goes to the targeted account
> 3. After that, it would follow users of the targeted account until failure (Until something saying I can't follow this much pops up)


- ### [Internet Speed Complaint Bot](https://twitter.com/InternetBo42959) ü§ñ (Day 51)
> 1. The program goes to https://www.speedtest.net and fetches internet speeds
> 2. Then it logs into twitter
> 3. After that, the program checks if my current internet speed is slower than my desired internet speed
> 4. If so, then it sends a tweet complaining about that
> 5. Else, it sends a tweet saying the internet speed is good

- ### Day 48 (Learning about Selenium, Complete "Cookie-clicker")
  - #### About Cookie Clicker made using Selenium
   > 1. Program starts auto-clicking on the cookie at https://orteil.dashnet.org/experiments/cookie/ using Selenium
   > 2. For every 10 seconds, the program checks the right panel of the game where upgrades can be purchased
   > 3. Then it purchases the the most expensive affordable upgrade
   > 4. After 5 minutes, the program ends and prints out number of 'Cookies per second'

- ### Amazon Price Tracker üíµ (Day 47)
> 1. First the program gets the price of the product (The url is given)
> 2. Then it checks if that price is smaller than the preferred purchase price in the code
> 3. If the above condition is true, then an e-mail would be sent with relevent information

- ### Musical Time Machine üéµ (Day 46)
> 1. This program asks user to enter a date in the format YYYY-MM-DD
> 2. Then it searches the top 100 songs at that time
> 3. After that, the program gets the URIs for the songs
> 4. Afterwards, it creates a spotify playlist (if it the playlist already doesn't exist)
> 5. Finally, It adds the songs into the playlist (if the above condition is true)
